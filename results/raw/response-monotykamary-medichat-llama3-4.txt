Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of how much your heart rate varies from beat to beat. It's an indicator of your body's response to stress and can be used to assess your overall health.

The normal range for HRV in healthy adults is 50-100 ms, but it can vary depending on factors like age, fitness level, and sleep quality. If you're concerned about your HRV, consult a doctor who can help determine what's normal for you.

HRV can be measured using a wearable device or an ECG (electrocardiogram). The measurement is usually taken over 24 hours to get the most accurate reading.

Here are some tips to improve your HRV:

* Get enough sleep. Sleep deprivation can lower HRV.
* Exercise regularly. Physical activity has been shown to increase HRV.
* Manage stress. Chronic stress can lower HRV, so try relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga.
* Eat a healthy diet. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may help improve HRV.

If you're concerned about your HRV, consult a doctor who can help determine what's normal for you and provide guidance on how to manage it.
