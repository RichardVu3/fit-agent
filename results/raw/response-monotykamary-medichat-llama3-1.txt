I can see that your heart rate has been relatively stable over the past month, with an average of about 77 beats per minute. The lowest value was 64 and the highest was 102.

Your resting heart rate is a good indicator of how well you're recovering from exercise. It's normal for it to vary slightly day-to-day, but if you notice that your resting heart rate has been consistently high or low, it might be worth discussing with your doctor.

The data also shows that your heart rate tends to increase when you do physical activity. For example, on January 30th, your average heart rate during exercise was about 116 beats per minute. This suggests that you're getting regular exercise and that your body is responding appropriately to it.

I can't see any specific data for VO2 Max, but I'm guessing this refers to the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during intense exercise. A high value indicates good cardiovascular fitness, so if you have a high VO2 Max, you're in great shape!

Finally, your heart rate recovery test result shows that it took 11.1 seconds for your heart rate to return to its resting level after one minute of exercise. This is a little higher than the average for someone of your age, but still within a healthy range.

Overall, your health data looks good! It's great that you're getting regular exercise and that your body is responding well to it. If you have any questions about your results or if there are other things you'd like me to look at, feel free to ask. I'm here to help!
