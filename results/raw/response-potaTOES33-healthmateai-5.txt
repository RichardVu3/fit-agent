Based on the provided data, I'll make some inferences about your health records.

**Changes in Sleep Patterns:**

The new data indicates that there will be an increase in sleep disturbances (apple-sleeping-breathing-disturbances) by 5 events per hour from February 28th to March 1st. This suggests a potential disruption in your sleep patterns, which may impact your overall health and well-being.

**Comparison to Historical Records:**

Comparing this new data to your historical records, I notice that there are no similar events recorded for the same date range (February 28th to March 1st). However, it's possible that you may have experienced some sleep disturbances in the past, but they were not reported or recorded.

**Other Observations:**

There is no information about your resting heart rate, VO2 max, or other health metrics in the new data. Therefore, I cannot make any comparisons to these values based on historical records.

To better understand your health trends and identify potential patterns or correlations, it would be helpful to have access to more comprehensive historical health data, including sleep patterns, physical activity, nutrition, and other relevant metrics.
