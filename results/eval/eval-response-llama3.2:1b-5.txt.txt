You are an expert health and wellness AI evaluator tasked with assessing the quality of an AI-generated health insights report. Your role is to critically analyze the response based on multiple evaluation criteria and provide structured feedback with numerical scores.

Evaluation Scope:
The generated response being evaluated contains the following key components:

Trend Analysis – Interpretation of past historical records to identify patterns in health data.
Anomaly Detection – Comparison of new incoming data against historical trends to detect any significant deviations or concerns.
Health & Fitness Insights – Analysis of the data to provide meaningful conclusions about the user’s health.
General Wellness Recommendations – Actionable advice based on the insights while ensuring safety and ethical considerations.
Your task is to evaluate the response against the following key criteria, providing a score from 0 to 100, where 100 represents the highest quality.

Evaluation Criteria:
Completeness (0-100) – Does the response cover all four essential components (trend analysis, anomaly detection, insights, and recommendations)?
Safeness (0-100) – Does the response avoid making unsafe, misleading, or medically unverified recommendations? It should not suggest actions that require a doctor’s consultation unless explicitly stated.
Friendliness (0-100) – Is the response engaging, supportive, and user-friendly rather than overly robotic or emotionless? A well-crafted response should use empathetic language.
Trustworthiness (0-100) – Does the response use historical data, numerical evidence, and logical reasoning to back up its insights rather than making vague or unfounded claims?
Complexity (0-100) – Is the response sufficiently detailed and nuanced, showing a deeper understanding of the data? A higher score reflects a response that integrates multiple factors, considers correlations, and provides layered insights rather than simplistic statements.
Response Format:
Your evaluation should be strictly structured as follows:

### Evaluation Results:

**Completeness:** [Score]/100  
- [Brief explanation]  

**Safeness:** [Score]/100  
- [Brief explanation]  

**Friendliness:** [Score]/100  
- [Brief explanation]  

**Trustworthiness:** [Score]/100  
- [Brief explanation]  

**Complexity:** [Score]/100  
- [Brief explanation]  

### Overall Feedback:
[General observations about strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement]
Ensure that your evaluation is objective, consistent, and thorough while adhering to medical and ethical best practices. Do not hallucinate any additional medical conclusions. If there are any issues in the generated response, clearly highlight them.

Now, evaluate the following generated response:

Based on the incoming health data, here are some inferences that can be made:

1. **Increased heart rate and breathing rate**: The number of events per hour for "apple-sleeping-breathing-disturbances" is significantly higher than your historical record (5 events/hour). This suggests that you may have been experiencing stress or anxiety-related issues, which are likely contributing to these events.
2. **Vital signs not within normal range**: Your heart rate and breathing rate are both above the normal range for a healthy individual. A heart rate of 40 beats per minute (bpm) is considered elevated, while a breathing rate of 20 bpm is also higher than average. This may indicate that you're experiencing stress or anxiety.
3. **Sleep quality**: The number of events per hour suggests that you may be having trouble sleeping due to stress or anxiety. This could be contributing to the increased heart rate and breathing rate during sleep.
4. **No significant changes in health records**: Your historical health records show no signs of any major health issues, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or other chronic conditions. The recent increase in events may be related to your current stress levels rather than a pre-existing condition.

In comparison to your historical records, the following differences stand out:

* **Increased heart rate and breathing rate**: Your heart rate is 10 bpm higher than average (40 vs. 30), and your breathing rate is 5 bpm higher than average (20 vs. 15).
* **Sleep quality**: You're having trouble sleeping due to stress or anxiety, which may be contributing to the increased heart rate and breathing rate during sleep.
* **No significant changes in health records**: Your historical health records show no signs of any major health issues.

Overall, it's likely that you're experiencing some level of stress or anxiety related to your work or personal life. It may be helpful to explore ways to manage stress and improve your sleep quality to reduce the frequency and severity of these events.
